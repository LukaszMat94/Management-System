  * Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2018
  * installed and configured Apache Maven 3.8.2
  * installed and configured Tomcat 9.0.54
 
## Setup
Before run this project, make sure that:

1. url, database, username and password is correctly setted in liquibase properties/datasource bean config:

    a) liquibase properties
      * url=jdbc:sqlserver://your_sql_url;databaseName=Management System
      * username=your_username
      * password=your_password
  
    b) the same scheme of work in datasource bean config:
      * dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:sqlserver://your_sql_url;databaseName=Management System");
      * dataSource.setUsername("your_username");
      * dataSource.setPassword("your_password");

2. install it locally using terminal:
```
$ mvn clean install
```

3. install example data into database:
```
$ mvn liquibase:update
```

## What's been done
This project contains:
 - basic configuration Spring with @Beans
 - connection with mssql to store data
 - CRUD operations with Spring Framework
 - validation of data with custom error response (with custom messages of validators)
 - store sensitive data with encryption in database (password)
 - relations One-to-One, Many-to-One (One-to-Many), Many-to-Many
 - response models schema as DTO objects
 - liquibase feature to simple manage database changes with Maven plugin
 - logging feature to log errors as rolling file

## Incoming updates

For improvement:
- Avoid cycle references when using mapstruct(Task <-> Employee) - currently ignored references in DTO objects 
- Create custom validation for attribute ZoneDateTime - currently no validation
- Optional: migrate spring/springdoc and others libraries to newer versions

Incoming Features:
- Add Spring Security: 
  * add login ui with authorization/authentication 
  * replace temporary AES256 with BCrypt encoding+matching
- Add files-management for Tasks and status of their progress (service files with .pdf extension)
- Add front-ui designed with HTML/CSS/JS (in progress) instead of current presentation (Swagger)
